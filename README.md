# Introduction

Connect Four was one of the few games that I enjoyed playing as a kid. Some of my fondest memories with my family were through board games so I decided to create Connect Four. Click [here](https://mike-trinh-connect-four.netlify.app) to try it out!


# Instruction

You start off with a board layout of 6 rows and 7 columns. The game is setup in a way that two players are able to play at a time. Each person makes one move per turn represented by two colors: Blue and Yellow. A player wins the game once they get 4 in a row. Players can get 4 in a row by having their color lined up vertically, horizontally, diagonally, and reverse-diagonally.
